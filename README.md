# 3D Models

The 3D Models repository contains a collection of 3D models representing statues, ruins, and temples. These models can be used in various applications, including virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), games, animations, and architectural visualizations.

## File Formats

The 3D models are provided in the Wavefront GLB file format, a widely supported format for storing 3D geometry data. Alongside the GLB files, you will find corresponding material files (MTL) and texture files (PNG or JPEG) if applicable.

Please note that the 3D models are provided as static assets and do not include any animations or rigging information.

## Usage

To use the 3D models from this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository

2. Navigate to the desired 3D model's folder.

3. Use the provided OBJ file along with its associated MTL and texture files, if available, in your application or 3D rendering pipeline.

4. Ensure that your application or software supports the Wavefront GLB file format for importing and rendering the 3D models.
